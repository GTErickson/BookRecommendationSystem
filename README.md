# BookRecommendationSystem

This repository stores the code for Team 19's Cpt_S 475 Data Science Final Project (Fall 2023)

The book recommendation system that we have created uses content-based filtering algorithms over the Book-Crossing Dataset to produce user-specific book recommendations.
The project was done entirely in R. 

How to run the application:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the BookRecommendationSystem.R
3. Modify the working directory with your own path
4. Execute the code to load the datasets
5. Execute the code to run the cleaning methods
6. Execute the code to load the functions
7. Execute the code to run the while loop for the menu system

The files for the code are as follows:
- BookRecommendationSystem.R --> This file contains the final code for the book recommendation system
- PreliminaryTesting.R --> This file contains the EDA filtering methods that we used to get familiar with the dataset
- DataVisualization.R --> This file contains the EDA data visualization that we did to better understand the users of the dataset
- users.R --> This file is the preliminary mockup of our multi-option menu-based application without the user-specific recommendation algorithms
- BX_Books.csv --> Stores all of the book information from the Book-Crossing dataset
- BX-Users.csv --> Stores all of the user information from the Book-Crossing dataset
- BX-Book-Ratings.csv --> Stores all of the rating information from the Book-Crossing dataset
