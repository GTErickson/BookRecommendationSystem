# BookRecommendationSystem

This Repo stores the code for Team 19's Cpt_S 475 Data Science Final Project.

The book reccomendation system that we have created uses content based filtering algorithms over the Book-Crossing Dataset to produce user specific book recommendations.
The project was done entirely in R. 

The files for the code are as Follows:
- BookRecommendationSystem.R --> This file contains the final code for the book recommendation system
- PreliminaryTesting.R --> This file contains the EDA filtering methods that we used to get fimiliar with the dataset
- DataVisualization.R --> This file contains the EDA data visualization that we did to better understand the users of the dataset
- users.R --> This file is the preliminary mockup of our multi-option menu based application without the user-specific recommendation algorithms
